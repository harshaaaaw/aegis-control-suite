"""Phase 1, Tracer 2: Ship Gate decision service.

The gate is the product: it certifies a candidate change as safe to ship, or
blocks it, with evidence. It wires the three engines:
  - run-replay  -> forensic verify the candidate run is intact
  - agent-sentinel -> shield the tool results / outbound content
  - evalforge   -> eval the candidate's behaviour against the golden set
and combines them into one signed verdict (verdict_id, decision, evidence refs).
