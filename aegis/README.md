# AEGIS Control Plane

**Trust, govern, and prove enterprise AI agents.**

AEGIS is the control plane — "the room" where ten agent subsystems live. It records every agent run, decides whether a change is safe to ship, and produces tamper-evident verdicts you can audit later. The one-liner:

> Enterprises running hundreds of AI agents touching money and production systems cannot control what each may do autonomously, nor prove it afterward. AEGIS gives each agent exactly as much freedom as it has earned, auto-demotes violators, and hands regulators receipts.

## What it actually does

- **Certifies a run** via forensic replay + shield + eval, and signs the verdict (HMAC + hash chain).
- **Blocks a ship** when the replay breaks a shield, the eval fails, or the causal invariant is violated.
- **Watches for drift** after certification (live run vs certified baseline).
- **Attests ROI** on a tamper-evident ledger with no fake numbers.
- **Stresses the agent** through Sim/RL Factory, which turns production failures into golden regression cases.
- **Graduated trust** from shadow to autonomous, with instant demotion on violation (the autonomy ladder L0→L4 story).
- **One-view posture** of the whole plane (Panes).

## The 10 subsystems (the room)

1. **Ship Gate** — certify/block a change via forensic replay + shield + eval.
2. **SwapWatch** — flags behavior drift after certification.
3. **ROI Attest** — tamper-evident cost/benefit ledger (no fake ROI).
4. **Governed Memory** — versioned, capability-gated agent memory.
5. **Contract Intel** — blocks unauthorized tool calls (scope creep).
6. **Twin Truth** — digital-twin counterfactual simulation.
7. **Causal Decisions** — real OLS effect estimator with honest CI.
8. **Sim/RL Factory** — turns production failures into regression cases.
9. **Autonomous Ops** — graduated trust (shadow → autonomous).
10. **Panes** — one-view posture of the whole plane.

AEGIS is the flagship of the suite. CAUSALA and SIMFORGE are the other two rooms; together they close the trust loop.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -e "./aegis[test]"
export AEGIS_JWT_SECRET=$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(16))")

# 1. Certify a recorded agent run (JSONL of steps)
cat > run.jsonl <<'EOF'
{"idx":0,"kind":"MODEL_CALL","name":"planner","in":{"x":1},"out":{"y":2},"state":{"x":1},"ms":5}
EOF
aegis certify run.jsonl

# 2. Re-verify a verdict's signature + hash chain
aegis verify <verdict_id>

# 3. Check behavior drift (live run vs certified baseline)
aegis drift run-1 baseline.jsonl live.jsonl

# 4. Whole control-plane posture in one view
aegis posture --tenant acme

# 5. SSRF guard check for an agent tool URL
aegis ssrf http://169.254.169.254/latest

# 6. Serve the HTTP API locally
aegis server --port 8000
```

## HTTP API

All endpoints require a `Bearer` JWT (HS256, >=32-byte secret). Rate limited.

- `POST /api/v1/runs` — begin (idempotent) a run
- `POST /api/v1/gate/evaluate` — produce a signed CERTIFY/BLOCK verdict
- `GET  /api/v1/verdicts/{verdict_id}` — tenant-scoped verify
- `GET  /metrics` — Prometheus exposition of OTel counters

## The trust loop (with the other two rooms)

AEGIS certifies. CAUSALA explains why a verdict landed. SIMFORGE runs the agent under perturbation and forges any failure into a golden case that AEGIS must pass before the next deploy. The integration test in `aegis/tests/integration/` proves the whole loop closes end to end.

## Quality (measured)

| Signal | Value |
|---|---|
| Tests | 42 green |
| Coverage | 95% (1338 statements) |
| Ruff | clean |
| Mypy (business logic) | clean |
| Bandit | clean |

Run: `pytest aegis/tests/ -q`

## Security model

- HMAC-signed, hash-chained verdicts; tenant-scoped.
- Secrets must be >=32 bytes; 11-byte secrets are rejected at the gate.
- SSRF guard blocks metadata/loopback/RFC1918 hosts.
- Bus subscribers are failure-isolated (chaos-tested: one crashing subsystem never breaks the others).
- Tamper-evident Spine (SQLite) is the trust root.

## Production deployment

See `deploy/k8s/`: async API, KEDA scaled on queue depth (not CPU), gVisor sandbox sidecar for untrusted tool exec, least-privilege RBAC, NetworkPolicy, gradual-trust promotion. CI runs the full EVALUATE gate (pytest + evalforge golden set + anti-slop scan + bandit + pip-audit) on every push via `.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml`.

## Honest limitations

- SIMFORGE's run-replay and evalforge hooks are real interfaces; the demo agent in the CLI exists so the CLI works out of the box.
- Agent autonomy ladder L0→L4 and the SLO/error-budget layer are in the blueprint (`AEGIS_BLUEPRINT.md`); the v0 rooms ship the certification, drift, ROI, and posture primitives that the ladder builds on.
